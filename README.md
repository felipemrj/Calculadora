# Calculator

This project is a **simple calculator** created with the goal of practicing the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. The idea is to implement each concept progressively and document the process, making it easy to understand each step and track the project's evolution. In addition, I will use this repository to practice versioning my code using GitHub.

## Project Development Stages

I divided the development into stages, similar to an academic project in which I developed a financing system for banks. This way I can apply the concepts gradually while also studying them. This repository will also have a documentation file where I'll present the updates as they go, as well as the processes behind my decisions, the problems I might face, and how I'll solve them.

### Stage 1: Initial Structuring [✅]
- Define program functionalities. 
- Plan the basic structure (folders, files, packages). 

### Stage 2: Class Design and Implementation [✅]
- Define the main classes. 
- Apply encapsulation.

### Stage 3: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction [✅]
- Create operation hierarchy (superclass and subclasses).
- Apply inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction where appropriate.

### Stage 4: Implementation & Testing (Iterative) [✅]
- Implement features and write tests for each.
- Handle errors and exceptions as features are added.

### Stage 5: User Interface (UI) [⌛]
- Implement the graphical interface.

### Stage 6: Refactoring and Improvements [⌛]
- Review and refactor code.
- Add new features or improvements.

### Stage 7: Final Documentation and Reflection [⌛]
- Document the project and reflect on learnings.
