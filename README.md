# Calculator

This project is a **simple calculator** created with the goal of practicing the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. The idea is to implement each concept progressively and document the process, making it easy to understand each step and track the project's evolution. In addition, I will use this repository to practice versioning my code using GitHub.

## Project Development Stages

I divided the development into stages, similar to an academic project in which I developed a financing system for banks. This way I can apply the concepts gradually while also studying them. This repository will also have a documentation file where I'll present the updates as they go, as well as the processes behind my decisions, the problems I might face, and how I'll solve them.

### **Stage 1: Initial Structuring**
- Define the basic structure of the project (folders, files, packages).
- Create the first main classes, such as `Calculator` and `Operation`.
- Define the access modifiers for the classes and attributes.

### **Stage 2: Encapsulation**
- Add attributes and getter/setter methods where appropriate.
- Ensure that the data is protected using access modifiers.

### **Stage 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- Create a hierarchy for the operations, with a superclass and subclasses.
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism.

### **Stage 4: Abstraction**
- Use abstract classes or methods.

### **Stage 5: Error Handling**
- Implement handling for possible errors and exceptions.

### **Stage 6: Testing**
- Perform tests to validate the functioning of the Calculator.

### **Stage 7: User Interface (UI)**
- Implement the calculator with a graphical interface.

### **Stage 8: Improvements**
- Add new features and improve the calculator.

### **Stage 9: Final Documentation**
- Reflection on the project, learnings, and next steps.
